A black and white image (not greyscale) is an easy thing to conceptualize, where a black pixel has a value of 1 
and a white pixel as a value of 0.
Color images have three color channels (RGB), with pixel values of 0-255 for each pixel. 
So a pixel with the value (255,255,255) would be entirely white while (0,0,0) would be black. The upper range is 255 because it is the largest value that can be represented by an 8 bit binary number. Binary is a base-two paradigm, in contrast to decimal which is in base-ten, which means you calculate the value of a binary number by summing the 2s exponent of each place where a 1 appears.""")
